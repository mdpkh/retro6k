## Programming the Retro 6k Emulator

Compile [sdk/retro6k-pg.tex](sdk/retro6k-pg.tex) using `pdflatex` and then consult `retro6k-pg.pdf`.

I generate my cartridges by using [vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/index.php?view=main) and its Oldstyle Syntax Module. [Windows vasm binaries](https://www.chibiakumas.com/z80/vasm.php) are available for download.

## Compiling the Retro 6k Emulator from Source

You'll need SDL2 headers and libraries, and if you're using MS Visual Studio, there are tutorials out there for setting up an SDL project. The source code uses C++17 standard library features, so make sure your development environment is up to date.

## Binary Releases

I intend to periodically provide releases with Windows 64-bit binaries.
